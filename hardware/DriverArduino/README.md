# Connecting the DR8N-3/15 (ДР8Н-3/15) sensor to arduino
## Water Flow Sensor

## Connecting to the board

The sensor is equipped with 6 contacts:
- Connector 1, power 5..24V
- Connector 2, earth
- Connector 3, pulse output 1 
- Connector 4, earth
- Connector 5, pulse output 2 
- Connector 6, earth

Connector 1 connects to 5v

Connector 2 connects to the port *GND*

Connector 3 connects to the port 2

Connector 4 connects to the port *GND*

The sensor is supplied with contacts that cannot be connected to the Arduino, so it is necessary to finalize the contacts.

### Sensor Feature

It is worth paying attention to the fact that the sensor has the direction of water flow.
